# Zabbix Monitoring System Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and configuration of Zabbix, an open-source monitoring solution for IT infrastructure. Zabbix provides real-time monitoring of servers, virtual machines, and network devices, ensuring optimal performance and quick problem detection.

**Tools Used:**

* **Cluster kind:** Used for container orchestration and managing the Zabbix components as containers.
* **MariaDB:** Used as the relational database for storing Zabbix data.
* **Zabbix-Agent:** Installed on monitored hosts to collect performance metrics and send them to the Zabbix server.
* **Zabbix-Server:** The core component responsible for collecting, storing, and analyzing monitoring data.

## Introduction

Zabbix is a powerful monitoring tool that allows organizations to track the health and performance of their IT infrastructure. This project showcases the setup and configuration of Zabbix for effective server monitoring using a containerized approach with Cluster kind and MariaDB.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of server resources
- Customizable alerts and notifications
- Performance metrics and graphing
- Host and service availability checks
- User-friendly web interface

## Installation

To set up this Zabbix monitoring system, you'll need to install the following components:

1. Cluster kind
2. MariaDB
3. Zabbix Server
4. Zabbix Agent

Detailed installation steps for each component, including using Cluster kind for container orchestration, are available in the [project documentation](docs/installation.md).

## Configuration

Key configuration steps include:

1. Database setup in MariaDB
2. Zabbix server configuration with containerized deployment
3. Web interface setup
4. Agent configuration on monitored hosts
5. Creating hosts and items in Zabbix
6. Setting up triggers and alerts

For detailed configuration instructions, refer to the [configuration guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Usage

After installation and configuration:

1. Access the Zabbix web interface
2. Add hosts for monitoring
3. Configure items, triggers, and graphs
4. Set up user alerts and notifications
5. Monitor your infrastructure through the dashboard
